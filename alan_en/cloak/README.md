# Directory Contents

- [`cloakv3.alan`][cloakv3.alan] — _Cloak of Darkness_ v1.
- [`cloakv3.ifid`][cloakv3.ifid] — IFID recovered from original `.a3c`.
- [`cloakv3.a3s`][cloakv3.a3s] — walkthrough commands script.
- [`cloakv3.a3t`][cloakv3.a3t] — generated walkthrough transcript.

The `cloakv3.alan` source was downloaded from the _[Cloak of Darkness: ALAN]_ page at [Roger Firth]'s website, along with the pre-compiled `cloakv3.a3c` storyfile, from which we were able to extract the original IFID and rebuild the [`cloakv3.ifid`][cloakv3.ifid] file.


# About Cloak of Darkness

_[Cloak of Darkness]_ is a well known sample adventure which has been implemented on many different IF authoring systems.
Based on the original idea and adventure by [Roger Firth], the ALAN version was implemented by Stephen Griffiths, then adapted to ALAN 3 by Thomas Nilsson (now [Thomas Nilefalk]).

The original ALAN 3 adaptation was implemented using ALAN 3.0alpha6 and lib 0.6.1, somewhere around September 2008.


# License

We couldn't find any license information regarding the ALAN implementation of _Cloak of Darkness_, nor for the original concept and adventure by [Roger Firth]; but it should be safe to assume that it's freely distributable, given the nature and spirit of the original project, and the fact that [Roger Firth] has been hosting and offering in download the various implementation of _[Cloak of Darkness]_ in different IF systems (including the ALAN version here reproduced) without ever questioning license terms.
