Hurrying through the rainswept November night, you're glad to see the
bright lights of the Opera House. It's surprising that there aren't more
people about but, hey, what do you expect in a cheap demo game...? 


Cloak of Darkness 
A basic IF demonstration. 

Version 3, September 2021. (ALAN 3.0Beta8, Foundation Library v0.2.2). 
Originally implemented by Stephen Griffiths for ALAN 2, readapted by the

Foyer of the Opera House
You are standing in a spacious hall, splendidly decorated in red and
gold, with glittering chandeliers overhead. The entrance from the street
is to the north, and there are doorways south and west.

Cloakroom
The walls of this small room were clearly once lined with hooks, though
now only one remains. The exit is a door to the east.

It's just a small brass hook screwed to the wall.

You can't take that!

You put the black velvet cloak on the small brass hook.

Foyer bar
The bar, much rougher than you'd have guessed after the opulence of the
foyer to the north, is completely empty. There seems to be some sort of
message scrawled in the sawdust on the floor.

> X MESSAGE
The message has been carelessly trampled, making it difficult to read.
You can just distinguish the words...
